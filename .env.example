# Gemini API key options
# - Default (recommended): Users bring their own key via Settings UI (stored locally).
# - Hackathon/demo convenience: Set NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY to ship a built-in key.
#   WARNING: NEXT_PUBLIC_* env vars are exposed to the browser.
#   If you do this, strongly consider restricting the key to your domain in Google Cloud.
